This is first basic car rental system I made in C++ in my first semester.
This is a CLI (Command Line Interface System).

Main reason to develop this system was to practice and evaluate the concept of programming fundamentals. All major fundamental concept of C++ are used in this systemm which are as follows:

•	Header Files (iostream, fstream)
•	User-Define Functions (display, rent, read)
•	If-else Statements
•	Loops (While Loop, Do-while Loop)
•	File Handling
